## Description
Tell us about your pull request!


**Please make sure your submission is in the correct directory**. In most cases, this is in submissions/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Week-Number/filename.

For example, if @codedentwickler is completing Week 1:
- I solved the Week 1 task.
- I create a new file inside submissions/codedentwickler/Week1/
- I name this file fizzbuzz.py, hence we have the fizzbuzz solution in submissions/codedentwickler/Week1/fizzbuzz.py
